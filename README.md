# RPS Challenge

Task
----

To build a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for Maker's marketing team, based on the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Functionality

- the marketeer can enter their name before the game
- the marketeer is presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game chooses a random option
- a winner is declared

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

I had intended to implement a "best of three" element to the game but ran out of time!

The formatting is super simple too, but it works!
